      <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool Program</h2>

      <p>
        I joined the Cloud Engineering program at AltSchool Africa to deepen my
        technical expertise and expand my ability to build and manage scalable
        applications. With a strong foundation in frontend development and
        JavaScript, I wanted to gain hands-on experience with cloud
        infrastructure, DevOps practices, and deployment automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This program provided the perfect opportunity to bridge the gap between
        development and cloud operations, allowing me to understand how
        applications are deployed, optimized, and secured in the cloud. My goal
        is to leverage these skills to build high-performing, scalable solutions
        while staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        This journey is about growth, innovation, and embracing new
        challengesâ€”one step closer to creating impactful digital experiences. ðŸš€
